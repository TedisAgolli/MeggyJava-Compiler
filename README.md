Duplicate Method and Class declaration:

We handle duplicate declarations by adding "**" at the end of the duplicate class or method name. This allows us to continue performing 
type checking.



AVR Code:

Our AVR code is generated correctly, but the MJSIM.jar gives an "import" error.
The same error is given for files generated by MJ_PA3.jar and MJ_PA5.jar shared by you.
